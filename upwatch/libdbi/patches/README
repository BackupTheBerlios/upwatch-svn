bbd-tee.patch:

Patch for bbd, so every incoming bb result will be mirrored
ot another bbd-compatible host. Can be used while converting
a bb setup to upwatch, to let results flow into both systems.
NOTE: after patching, fill in the ip address of the mirror host!!


libpcap-linux-timeout.patch:

Adds timeout support to the linux libpcap library.
Don't know if that's still needed for the newest versions.
