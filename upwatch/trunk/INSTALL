This is version 0.1 of UpWatch, a device monitoring and statistics
framework. UpWatch boasts extendability, extreme speed and scalability,
useful statistics and graphs, and a web interface.

Currently it uses PHP, MySQL, and the daemons are written in C.

 
Basic Installation
==================

First the requirements. If you install from source, you need the 
following packages including any development files like headers 
and libraries:

- gcc, make, autoconf etcetera.
- autogen + autoopts
- gzip 
- glib2
- gnet
- mysql
- curl
- libpcap
- libnet

If you install the RPM you need to install the following rpm's:

- gnet
- glib2
- mysql
- curl
- libpcap
- libnet

1a. Supposing you install the RPM's: that's easy.

	rpm -Uvh upwatch-*.rpm

    This also creates the upwatch user and installs
    the php scripts in its home directory.
    Now skip to step 2.

1b. Installing from source needs the standard sequence:

	./configure
	make 
	make install

    Next create the upwatch user:

	/usr/sbin/adduser upwatch

    or something along those lines. And copy the php 
    tree to some place you want to have it.

2.  Now you must create the database. For this we provide a mysql 
    script. Create the database:

	mysqladmin create upwatch
 	mysql < config/upwatch.mysql

    You may want to tweak the mysql creation script to change some
    tables from MySQL into InnoDB. This will give you transactions.
    Usually this is not necessary.


Configuration
=============

Configuration is done through config scripts /etc/upwatch.conf
and per-probe configs in /etc/upwatch.d. Read the manpages 
for more info. Every long option can also be entered in the
config files.

In case of problems, look in /var/log/upwatch.log.


Testing
=======

The easiest test is to create a ping probe. Point your browser
to the php entry page. Create a host, on that host create a 
ping probe. The host will be ping'ed by uw_ping within a 
couple of minutes.
