       <para> The upwatch package contains various ways of logging errors. The
         standard way is to its own logfile <filename>/var/log/upwatch/upwatch.log</filename>.
         Other ways are logging to stderr (probably not practical) and to the syslog. Tweak the 
         <varname>debug</varname> to increase the amount of logging. Setting the debug level
         higher than 2 should only be used for debugging serious problems, for example it
         causes daemons to stay always in the foreground. In debuglevel 0 only errors are logged,
         in debuglevel 1 some progress information is logged.

       <para> The website has its own logfile in <filename>log/error.log</filename></para>

       <title>Managing daemons</title>
       <para> In most Linux distributions you can start/stop daemons using the scripts
         in <filename>/etc/init.d</filename>. Don't forget: you will miss sample data in the database
         if a probe is not running.

       <title>Queues</title>
       <para> Queues play an important part in upwatch. The queues are so-called <varname>maildir</varname>
       queues. This means that while the queuefile is written, it is written to a temporary directory, and when it's
       closed it is hardlinked to the actual queue directory. This way you can be absolutely sure that if you find
       a file in the queue, it is complete and nobody has the file open. Only one process reads from the
       queue and deletes the file when done. </para>
