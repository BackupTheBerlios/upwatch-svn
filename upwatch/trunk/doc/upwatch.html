            either because a lot of money may be involved, or their job (or both). If you want to
            prove your website (or switch, or basically any other device) was available, showed the
            proper performance, or just want to know current and past CPU load, you've come to the

    The Netherlands. We are a hosting company which started in 1993 (when even Bill Gates knew
    nothing of the internet). We started doing managed hosting in 1995, and that's when
    we found out about monitoring. The hard way.</p><p>It became clear that customers can easily bring down their own server on impossible
    moments, and that it doesn't look very good if you both find out about that the monday 
    after. So we started doing SLA's and limit customer rights on their own server.</p><p>Initially we used Big Brother (bb4.com) for monitoring. This is an outstanding
    and useful package, and we have been using it for many years. But it has a few downsides.
    One is scalability. It does not scale well to hundreds of hosts. Also it has a
    geek-like look, we felt we couldn't give the URL to our customers. Third problem
    was integration with our backoffice.</p><p>At the same time yours truly was thinking about setting up a commercial
    service for monitoring servers remotely. All this culminated into UpWatch. So lets get 
    straight to the ..</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="Upwatch_features"></a>1.2. Features</h2></div></div><p>This is the full list of upwatch features:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Scalable: designed for monitoring tens of thousands of hosts</p></li><li><p>Resilient: autorestarts after database failures, forgiving for operator errors</p></li><li><p>SuSE, RedHat and Fedora RPM's generated from sourcetree for easy installation</p></li><li><p>Extensive and complete documentation, partly generated from source</p></li><li><p>Multi-tenanting: multiple companies can run monitoring services for network
