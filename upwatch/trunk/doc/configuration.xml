    <para> Most important things to configure are database access for probes. The file
       <filename>/etc/upwatch.conf</filename> contains defaults for all probes. These
       can be overridden in <filename>/etc/upwatch.d/probe.conf</filename>. Look
       in the probe manual pages for details. Every long commandine option can also
       be entered in a configuration file.
