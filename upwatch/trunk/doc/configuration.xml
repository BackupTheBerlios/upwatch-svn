       <para>
          Each probe first reads the general configuration file <filename>/etc/upwatch.conf</filename>
          and then its own configurationfile in <filename>/etc/upwatch.d</filename> if it exists.
          Normally some general things like the debug and logging level, and the database access
          are specified in the first file, and any probe-specific setting in the second file. You can also
          override settings from the generic file in the probe-specific file.
       </para>
       <para> Each program has a manual page that documents options. Every long commandine option
          can also be entered in a configuration file.
