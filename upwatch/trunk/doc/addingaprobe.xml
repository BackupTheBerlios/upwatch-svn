       <title>So you want to add a probe?</title>
       <para> Are you really sure? Adding a probe involves writing C code, creating and designing database
          tables and queue result files, creating PHP pages, and PHP graphs, writing documentation and submitting
          these changes to CVS. It is a lot of work, how rewarding it may be. </para>
       <para> In the following overview we'll show you how to add a probe. All man-pages, spec-files, documentation
          will be auto-generated if you follow instructions below.</para>

       <sect2 id="Think_carefully_befire_you_start">
          <title>Think carefully before you start</title>
          <para> You should not think lightly of adding a probe. Think things over before you start. Isn't there a
             probe available you can use? Or maybe you can get away with extending an existing one? If not,
             perhaps you can copy and modify one? </para>
          <para> If not, you're in for the rewarding process of adding a new probe. Go to the next step.</para>
       </sect2>
       <sect2 id="Pick_a_name">
          <title>Pick a real good name</title>
          <para> You should think of a real good descriptive name for your probe. It should describe
             exactly what it does. Leave room for future probes that do something similar, also think about
             future extension to the probe itself.. Don't be satisfied too soon. For the rest of this small tutorial, we'll
             assume you probe willed be called <varname>cputemp</varname> for monitoring the host CPU
             temperature.</para>

       <sect2 id="Design_the_database_layout">
          <title>Design the Database Layout</title>
          <para>Take a close look at the database layout for existing probes. Each probe at least consists of the
             following tables:</para>
          <itemizedlist>
             <listitem><para>A definition table (of course). This contains the probe id, target, last status, when to turn yellow
             or red</para></listitem>
             <listitem><para>Table for raw output, all results are kept here</para></listitem>
             <listitem><para>Tables for hour/day/week/month/year/5year summarisations</para></listitem>
             <listitem><para>A history table to keep all status changes</para></listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
          <para> Design these tables in <filename>uw_cputemp.mysql</filename>. You will copy this file in
            the next section.</para>
          <para> Create the database. </para>
          <para> Also a probe needs to enter its status into pr_status, and its history into pr_history and you should
             add code for this in the <application>uw_process</application> part..</para>
       </sect2>
       <sect2 id="write_the_code">
          <title>Write the code</title>
          <para> Create a new directory named <filename>uw_cputemp</filename>, copy all files in
             <filename>templates/probe</filename> to it. Look into
             those files, do a search and replace all occurrences of <varname>template</varname> with
             <varname>cputemp</varname>. Go one
             directory up, edit <filename>configure.in</filename>. Add a line <filename>uw_cputemp/Makefile</filename>
              to the  <varname>AC_CONFIG_FILES</varname> section. Add <varname>uw_cputemp</varname> to the
             <varname>PROGNAMES</varname> variable in <filename>Makefile.am</filename>. Run:
          </para>
          <literallayout>
                $ ./autogen.sh
                $ ./configure
                $ cd uw_cputemp
                $ make clean
                $ make
          </literallayout>
          <para> No errors should show up.
          </para>
          <para> Now start coding in <filename>uw_cputemp/run.c</filename>, specifically in the function
             <function>run()</function>. You should have enough examples in the other probes. Basically the
             probe should read a list of probedefinitions from a database, execute all probes, and writes the
             results into a spoolfile. There are utility functions for doing this in libupwatch.
          </para>
          <important><para>Test your code thoroughly for memory leaks and error conditions.</para></important>

       <sect2 id="Write_the_uw_process_extension">
          <title>Write the <varname>uw_process</varname> extension</title>
          <para> The output of your probe is processed by <varname>uw_process</varname>. You should
            add a new source file called <filename>process_cputemp.c</filename>, that reads the probe results
            and writes them to the database tables. Be careful for the logic in this part. Add an entry in the
            <varname>struct _probe_proc</varname> array in <filename>uw_process/run.c</filename>, and
            a <function>extern int process_cputemp(char *spec, GString *remark);</function> just above it.
          </para>

                   table in the database.

          <para> Note that every probe is documented briefly in the <filename>cmd_options.def</filename> file.
             You should also document the probe in this manual. Personally I use KDE's <application>Kate</application>
             with the <application>XML plugin</application>. Go the the <filename>doc</filename> directory.
             Copy <filename>template-specs.xml</filename> to <filename>cputemp-specs.xml</filename>. Add a line
             to <filename>probesspecs.xml</filename>, and an ENTITY line at the top of <filename>upwatch.xml</filename>.
             Add <filename>cputemp-specs.xml</filename> to the <varname>XMLFILES</varname> line in
             <filename>Makefile.am</filename>. Rerun <application>./autogen.sh</application>,
             <application>./configure</application> in the top directory. Run <application>make</application> in
             the doc directory.
