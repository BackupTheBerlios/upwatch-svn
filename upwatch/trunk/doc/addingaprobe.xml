       <title>So you want to add a probe?</title>
       <para> Are you really sure? Adding a probe involves writing C code, creating and designing database
          tables and queue result files, creating PHP pages, and PHP graphs, writing documentation and submitting
          these changes to CVS. It is a lot of work, though potentially very rewarding. </para>
