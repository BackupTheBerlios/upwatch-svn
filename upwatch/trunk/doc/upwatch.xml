        <para> People, especially managers, like to have facts and figures when taking decisions,
            either because a lot of money may be involved, or their job (or both). If you want to
            prove your website (or switch, or basically any other device) was available, showed the
            proper performance, or just want to know current and past CPU load, you've come to the
            right place.</para>
        <para> UpWatch is scalable, fast, extensible, built on proven opensource tools, and tries
            very hard not to loose data.</para>
