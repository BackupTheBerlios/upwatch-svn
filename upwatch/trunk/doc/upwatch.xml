<para>
People, especially managers, like to have facts and figures when
taking decisions, either because a lot of money may be involved,
or their job (or both). If you want to prove your website (or switch,
or basically any other device) was available, showed the proper performance,
or just want to know current and past CPU load, you've come to the right place.
</para>
<para>
UpWatch is scalable, fast, extensible, built on proven opensource tools,
and is built not to loose data.

<title>Getting upwatch</title>
<para>
Currently, upwatch is not released, and is not allowed to be distributed.
The only way to get it, is through written permission of UpWatch BV.
</para>

<para>
If you aquired that, you will either receive access to CVS, or will
receive a tar.gz file, or .RPM's.

<title>Run-time requirements</title>

<para>
Run time requirements differ per probe. Look in the corresponding
.def file (or in the spec file for the probe, here's a list of
everything we expect on a machine running all probes, and the database
(I'll also list the version we use ourselves):
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>glib2 2.0.1</listitem>
<listitem>gnet 1.1.2</listitem>
<listitem>mysql 3.23.49</listitem>
<listitem>cURL 7.9.5</listitem>

<para>
Of course you can build the software yourself.
Apart from the normal GNU compilation tools, and the aforementioned packages,
you'll need the following on your system to build upwatch:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>autogen 5.3.6</listitem>
<listitem>libxslt 1.0.15</listitem>
<listitem>kdelibs 3.0.0(for docbook)</listitem>
<listitem>lynx 2.8.4</listitem>
<listitem>RPM tools, if you want to build RPM's</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>If you run redhat, debian or SuSe, don't forget to install the
devel packages if there are any.</para>
</sect2>

<sect1 id="Compiling upwatch">
<title>Compiling upwatch</title>
<para>
Just in case you really want to (or need to) compile upwatch yourself, it's
pretty easy:</para>
<literallayout>
tar xzvf upwatch-x.x.tar.gz
cd upwatch-x.x
./configure
make
</literallayout>
<para>Nothing to it... In case of problems, you're probably missing some library
or header files, or they are in unexpected places. Look in config.log.</para>

<title>Actual Installation</title>
<para>
Before you install the software decide on the architecture. If you know in advance
yuo'll have to monitor thousands of hosts, or the probes will exhaust your
machine otherwise, you may have to split your installation across several
machines. There may be more reasons to do that. Consult <link linkend="Scaling up">Scaling up</link>
