        <para> People, especially managers, like to have facts and figures when taking decisions,
            either because a lot of money may be involved, or their job (or both). If you want to
            prove your website (or switch, or basically any other device) was available, showed the
            proper performance, or just want to know current and past CPU load, you've come to the
            right place.</para>
        <para> UpWatch is very scalable (built for hundres of thousands of measurements per minute),
            fast, extensible, built on proven opensource tools, and tries
            very hard not to loose data.</para>
       <para>Building and installing upwatch is not for the faint of heart. It uses lots of external
          libraries which may or may not be available on your platform. I myself use Redhat 8
          for development, and test compilation on RH7, and Yellowdog Linux 2.3.
