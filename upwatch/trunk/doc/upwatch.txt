Preface

   People,  especially  managers,  like  to  have  facts and figures when
   taking  decisions,  either  because a lot of money may be involved, or
   their  job (or both). If you want to prove your website (or switch, or
   basically   any   other  device)  was  available,  showed  the  proper
   performance,  or  just  want to know current and past CPU load, you've
   come to the right place.

1.1. History

   UpWatch  is  born  from  the  loins  of  Netland Internet Services BV,
   Amsterdam,  The Netherlands. We are a hosting company which started in
   1993  (when  even Bill Gates knew nothing of the internet). We started
   doing  managed  hosting  in  1995,  and that's when we found out about
   monitoring. The hard way.

   It  became clear that customers can easily bring down their own server
   on  impossible moments, and that it doesn't look very good if you both
   find  out  about  that the monday after. So we started doing SLA's and
   limit customer rights on their own server.

   Initially  we  used  Big  Brother (bb4.com) for monitoring. This is an
   outstanding  and  useful  package,  and we have been using it for many
   years.  But  it  has  a few downsides. One is scalability. It does not
   scale well to hundreds of hosts. Also it has a geek-like look, we felt
   we  couldn't  give  the  URL  to  our  customers.  Third  problem  was
   integration with our backoffice.

   At  the  same  time  yours  truly  was  thinking  about  setting  up a
   commercial   service   for   monitoring  servers  remotely.  All  this
   culminated into UpWatch. So lets get straight to the ..
