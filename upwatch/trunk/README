This is version 0.1 of UpWatch, a device monitoring and statistics
framework. UpWatch boasts extendability, extreme speed and scalability,
useful statistics and graphs, and a web interface.

Currently it uses PHP, MySQL, and the daemons are written in C.
 
CVS =================================================================

If you have CVS access, issue the following commands:

cvs checkout upwatch
./autogen.sh

Use `make dist` to create a tar.gz file, then run 
`rpm -ta upwatch-xx.tar.gz`. This will create rpm files.
