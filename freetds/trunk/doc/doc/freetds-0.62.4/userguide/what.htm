CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>ct-lib</SPAN

That means every form of Unix&reg; and Unix-like&trade; system (including notable variants such as Interix&reg; and QNX&reg;), as well as Win32&reg;, VMS&reg;, and OS X&reg;.  If it doesn't compile on your system &mdash; and you're not using MS-DOS&reg; &mdash; it's probably considered a bug.

><P
><SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TDS</SPAN
> is a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>protocol</I
>, a set of rules describing how to transmit data between two computers.  Like any protocol, it defines the types of messages that can be sent, and the order in which they may be sent.  Protocols describe the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"bits on the wire"</SPAN
>, how data flow.  
			</P
><P
>In reading this manual, it may be helpful to keep in mind that a protocol is not an <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</SPAN
>, although the two are related.  The server recognizes and speaks a protocol; anything that can send it the correct combination of bytes in the right order can communicate with it.  But programmers aren't generally in the business of sending bytes; that's the job of a library.  Over the years, there have been a few libraries -- each with its own <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</SPAN
> -- that do the work of moving SQL through a <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TDS</SPAN
> pipe.  <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>ODBC</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>db-lib</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>ct-lib</SPAN
>, and  <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>JDBC</SPAN
> have very different <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</SPAN
>s, but they're all one to the server, because on the wire they speak <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TDS</SPAN
>.  
			</P
><P
>The <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TDS</SPAN
> protocol was designed and developed by Sybase Inc. for their Sybase <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>SQL Server</SPAN
> relational database engine in 1984.  The problem Sybase faced then still exists: There was no commonly accepted application-level protocol to transfer data between a database server and its client.  To encourage the use of their product, Sybase came up with a flexible pair of products called <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>netlib</SPAN
> and <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>db-lib</SPAN
>.
  			</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>netlib</SPAN
>'s job was to ferry data between the two computers.  To do that, it had to deal with the underlying network protocol.  Remember, in those days <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TCP/IP</SPAN
> was not the ubiquitous thing it is today.  Besides <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TCP/IP</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>netlib</SPAN
> ran on <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>DECnet</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>IPX/SPX</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>NetBEUI</SPAN
> and the like.   
			</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>db-lib</SPAN
> provided an <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</SPAN
> to the client program, and communicated with the server via <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>netlib</SPAN
>.  What <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>db-lib</SPAN
> sent to the server took the form of a stream of bytes, a structured stream of bytes meant for tables of data, a Tabular Data Stream.  
			</P
><P
>In 1990 Sybase entered into a technology sharing agreement with Microsoft which resulted in Microsoft marketing its own <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>SQL Server</SPAN
>. Microsoft kept the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>db-lib</SPAN
> <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</SPAN
> and added <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>ODBC</SPAN
>.  (Microsoft has since added other <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</SPAN
>s, too.)

At about the same time, Sybase introduced a more powerful <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"successor"</SPAN
> to <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>db-lib</SPAN
>, called <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>ct-lib</SPAN
>, and called the pair <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
><I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>OpenClient</I
></SPAN
>.  
			</P
><P
>&#13;<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>ct-lib</SPAN

CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>db-lib</SPAN

CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>ODBC</SPAN

CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</SPAN

CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>netlib</SPAN
> to communicate to the server.  The language they use is <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TDS</SPAN
>.  
			</P
><P
>The <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>TDS</SPAN
> protocol comes in several flavors, most of which have never
been openly documented.  If anything, it's probably considered to be something like a trade secret, or at least proprietary technology.  The exception is TDS 5.0, used exclusively by Sybase, for which documentation is available <A
