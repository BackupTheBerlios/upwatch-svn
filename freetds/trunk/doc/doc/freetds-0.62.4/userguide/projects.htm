The <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>FreeTDS</SPAN
> 0.60 ODBC driver was a vast improvement over earlier versions, and 0.61 began to comply with the ODBC 3.0 specification.
0.62 should be fully ODBC 3.0 compatible and contain many fixes and improvements (<SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>ODBC</SPAN
>  <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>RPC</SPAN
> parameters, descriptors and others).  Any problems found in the currently implemented <SPAN

>How big is it?  <SPAN

CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>FreeTDS</SPAN

>You may be wondering how these libraries fit with Perl, PHP, TCL, Python, or other popular scripting languages.  Most of these languages have bindings to Sybase that use either the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>db-lib</SPAN
> or <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>ct-lib</SPAN
> <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>API</SPAN
>, for which <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>FreeTDS</SPAN
> is intended as a drop-in replacement.  For instance, Michael Peppler's <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>DBD::Sybase</SPAN
> works very well using <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>FreeTDS</SPAN
> to access Sybase or Microsoft <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"

CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PHP</SPAN

CLASS="FILENAME"
>sybase-ct</TT
> (<SPAN

CLASS="ACRONYM"
